# Buffer overflow exploits

These exploits were learned in the exploit development training provided by SEC4US with @helviojunior. Thank you homie.
## Pre requirements

Windows 10 w/o AV/EDR

Immunity debugger installed

mona.py script installed - [MONA](https://github.com/corelan/mona)

An application with buffer flow vanilla vulnerability and exposed to network through a TCP port (it's a RCE exploit).

Don´t forget to edit the IP and port to the real target.

Don´t forget to edit the exploit with your own data like EIP, SEH, offset and so on.


## Buffer overflow vanilla exploit for a Windows x86 (32 bits) PoC

```bash
./exp_bof_vanilla_poc.py
```

This is a PoC to a buffer overflow vanilla portable to python3. 


## Buffer overflow SEH exploit for a Windows x86 (32 bits) PoC

```bash
./exp_bof_seh_poc.py
```

This is a PoC to a buffer overflow SEH portable to python3.
